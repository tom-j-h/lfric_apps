    =       in an entrainment zone or not (based on the presence of a
    =       local maximum in dTl/dz).  Model-levels inside an entrainment

    =       Model-levels not diagnosed to be in an entrainment zone
    =       have a symmetrical distribution / no skewness.
    = (2) - Subcritical-only method; as (1), but the diagnosis of an
    =       entrainment zone additionally requires that the zone overlaps
    =       with a turbulent layer (either Ri < 1, or below the top height
    =       of non-local boundary-layer mixing).
    = (3) - Entraining parcel method; all model-levels are allowed to have

    =       based on the properties of entraining parcels subsided from
    =       above / ascended from below.  The entrainment rate scales with

help=Current parametrizations of FSD (fractional standard deviation,
    =a measure
    =of subgrid variability) of cloud water content used in radiation and
    =microphysics schemes are based on observations taken in a 1D line. For the
    =UM we require the FSD for a 2D gridbox,
    =which is generally larger. We
    =account for this difference by multiplying the 1D fsd by this value.
